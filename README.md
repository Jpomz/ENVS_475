Course materials for ENVS475 at CO Mesa University

## About 
This repository will serve as the unofficial collection of materials for ENVS475 Experimental Analysis and Design at Colorado Mesa University. 

The goal of this website is to create a central repository for students registered in the class as well as other interested persons to access all course materials. If you have any issues or problems, feel free to contact me at jpomeranz [at] coloradomesa [dot] edu
