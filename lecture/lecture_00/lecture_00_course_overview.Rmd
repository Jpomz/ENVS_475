**Office**: WS 230E, 

* MWF 9:30-10:30 am

* Tuesday: Zoom, by appointment.


## Course schedule and materials

**Texts** (Available for free):

* *The New Statistics with R* by Andy Hector.

  + Available through the Library

* *R for Data Science* by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund

  + Available for free online: [https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)

All learning materials on D2L

* Brief tour of D2L site

## Course Objectives: *Applied* Statistics

**Objectives**: 

* Practical information on designing experiments and analyzing data 

* **Analysis Life Cycle**

  + Research Question
  
  + **Study Design**
  
  + Data entry, management
  
  + **Data Visualization**
  
  + **Statistical Analyses and interpretation**
  

## Program Student Learning Outcomes: 

1. Design an environmental study. (Quantitative skills, critical thinking skills)

2.  Work with data to visualize, analyze, and interpret the results. (Quantitative skills, critical thinking skills)

## Software

* Course taught in R

* No prior experience needed

* If using your own computer, ensure that R and R Studio are downloaded before next class
  
  + See instructions on D2L
  
## Why R?

* R is free and open source
* Runs on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.)
* Promotes "Open Science"
  + e.g., combats the ["replication crisis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis)
* Widely used in Env Sci, Ecology, etc.
  + e.g., Grad School!
* R is an in-demand skill used across industries
  + Search for "R Programmer" on Indeed.com
* It's 2023, knowing some computer programming will help

## General Course Structure

**Course mantra**: work hard, learn a game-changing tool for your research, and have an incredibly in-demand skill to help land you a job!

This course broadly follows the I do, we do, you do methodology. 

*Generally*:

* Monday - Lecture on topic (I do)

* Wednesday - "Lab" on topic (We do)

* Friday - Open to work on assignments (You do)

Exception: First couple of weeks

## Grading

(Approximately) Weekly homework assignments (60% of grade) 

* 6 graded: 10% each

Meant to help with:

* Understanding lecture/lab concepts
      
* Implementing models in R
      
* Interpreting and presenting results

Two exams (40% of grade)

* Take-home, open-note format
* You will have 1-2 weeks to complete exam
* Class time will be provided to work on it and ask questions
  
## Homework
* There will be approximately 14 assignments (16 weeks - 2 exam weeks). 
* A minimum of 6 will be graded ($\sim$ 10% each).
  + Assignments for a grade will be approximately every-other-week
  + It will be explicit which ones are graded and not. 

* Material builds on itself throughout semester. You are strongly encouraged to complete **ALL** assignments. 

* Assignments are due Friday at 5 pm of the following week
  + Automatic 2 day grace period, afterwards - 50% 
  + Assignments will not be accepted after 5 days (Wednesday) passed due date 
  
## Homework Grading Rubric
* Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
* Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect answer: 90%
* Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept; OR complete assignment submitted after 2-day grace period: 50%
* Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept; OR mostly incomplete: 0%

Solutions to assignments will be posted on D2L and/or will be gone over in class. 

## Basic Outline

1) Introduction to R and Rstudio

2) Foundational concepts for statistical inference

3) Summary Statistics

4) Basic linear models

5) Null hypothesis significance testing

6) Comparing means (t-tests, ANOVA)

7) Regressions 

## Looking Forward

**Homework:**

* Download R and RStudio (in that order) on personal computer (if using)

* Next class: Introduction to R and Rstudio (Lab 01A and 01B on D2l)
  
* If time allows: Brief tour of Rstudio
  + Follow along on ENVS laptops or personal if software already downloaded
