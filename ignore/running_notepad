re download ggplot data sets and name them correctly

week01 intro to R lab and assignment done
week02 distributions lab and homework done
week03 dplyr lab done
week04 ggplot / summary stats

dplyr lab updated (maybe add distibution plot?)
make new assignment for dplyr (if keeping)
- focus on stats
- group_by(), summarize(), etc.
- use terui lab tutorial - basis
- modify to include things we've already discussed in class
-- make a distribution plot

dplyr - lab and homework done
ggplot lab and hw done
  maybe add more summary stats, i.e., boxplot
    or just do this later in course when it comes up, but be sure to use ggplot
